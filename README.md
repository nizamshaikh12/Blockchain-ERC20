# Blockchain Technologies: Industrial Applications & Smart Contracts

# Project Overview
This repository showcases a multi-dimensional project as it combines research into global blockchain adoption with hands-on development of decentralized assets on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

# Part I: Practical Implementation (Solidity)
This section contains the smart contracts developed using the **Remix IDE** and deployed via **MetaMask**.

# 1. ERC-20 Tokenization (Niz Galaxy Token - NGT)
**Contract Address:** `0xcbdfab059bf1801944a1c0077fec95f24e8d7809`.
**Functionality:** Created a supply of 200 NGT tokens, demonstrating automated distribution and wallet-to-wallet transfers on the Sepolia testnet.

# 2. ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens (Elements - ELMT)
**Contract Address:** `0x2824c03111137316AdEd9050207F605b363246d0`.
**Concept:** Minted four unique NFT's representing the "Four Elements of the World" (Air, Earth, Fire, Water).
**Tools:** Used **Pinata** for decentralized metadata storage (IPFS/JSON).

## Part II: Research & Case Studies
A deep-dive analysis into how Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is disrupting four major sectors:

**Financial Realm (NASDAQ Linq):** Analysis of how blockchain reduces settlement times from 3 days to 10 minutes.
**Cybersecurity (IBM Trade):** Exploration of decentralized trust and anonymized threat sharing.
**Manufacturing (Walmart/IBM Food Trust):** Case study on reducing food traceability time from 7 days to 2.2 seconds.
**Agricultural Sector (AgriDigital):** Analysis of automated grain deliveries and climate risk stability via smart contracts.
